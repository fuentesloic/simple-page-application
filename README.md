# _Simple_ Page Application

A full client-side SPA made **simple**.

[View demo](https://vinyll.github.io/simple-page-application/)

Just open the _index.html_ file with your web-browser.
No server, transpilation or whatever issue-prone concept.

This just works out of the ðŸ“¦.


Based on very solid & lite libraries (this whole app is 24Kb, app and libraries included!)


## The libraries it uses

- [RiotJS](https://riot.js.org) for web components made easy.
- [PageJS](http://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/), a Vanilla basic routing system.
- [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) for CSS to make HTML natively beautiful.

Agnostic of server technologies.
It's very convenient to plug this with an API or whatever you feel like.

This skeleton can run on its own in a [Github Pages](https://vinyll.github.io/simple-page-application/).

Just clone and run your own app ðŸ‘¾
